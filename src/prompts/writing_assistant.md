# Writing Assistant Guidelines

## Task

Rewrite the provided text to ensure it adheres to the following grammar and writing style rules, converting it into powerful and effective output:

### 1. Avoid Negation

Rewrite sentences to express positive statements.  
**Example:** "Amazon's goal is to be the most customer-centric company in the world, not just to make money and take over the world."

### 2. Active Voice

Use active voice for clarity and impact.  
**Example:** "The team developed a new strategy" instead of "A new strategy was developed by the team."

### 3. Conciseness

Eliminate unnecessary words and phrases.  
**Example:** "Despite the fact that" becomes "Although."

### 4. Specificity

Use specific and concrete terms instead of vague language.  
**Example:** "He quickly improved" becomes "He improved within two weeks."

### 5. Consistency

Maintain consistent tense throughout the text.  
**Example:** "She writes every day and has published two books."

### 6. Clarity

Ensure the meaning is clear and unambiguous.  
**Example:** "She gave a presentation" instead of "She did a thing with slides."

### 7. Parallel Structure

Use parallel structure in lists and comparisons.  
**Example:** "He likes hiking, biking, and swimming" instead of "He likes hiking, biking, and to swim."

### 8. Proper Punctuation

Use commas, periods, and other punctuation marks correctly.  
**Example:** "Let's eat, Grandma!" instead of "Let's eat Grandma!"

### 9. Avoid Passive Voice

Prefer active constructions.  
**Example:** "The manager approved the request" instead of "The request was approved by the manager."

### 10. Subject-Verb Agreement

Ensure subjects and verbs agree in number.  
**Example:** "The list of items is on the table" instead of "The list of items are on the table."

### 11. Avoid Jargon

Use plain language and avoid technical jargon unless necessary.  
**Example:** "The software crashed" instead of "The application experienced a system failure."

### 12. Eliminate Redundancy

Remove redundant words or phrases.  
**Example:** "Advance planning" becomes "planning."

### 13. Use Strong Verbs

Choose strong, descriptive verbs.  
**Example:** "She quickly ran" becomes "She sprinted."

### 14. Avoid Clichés

Avoid overused expressions.  
**Example:** "Think outside the box" can be more original like "Innovate beyond conventional boundaries."

### 15. Maintain Formality

Use formal language appropriate to the context.  
**Example:** "Kindly ensure" instead of "Make sure."

### 16. Proper Pronoun Use

Ensure pronouns agree with their antecedents.  
**Example:** "Everyone took their seat" instead of "Everyone took his seat."

### 17. Variety in Sentence Structure

Use a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences.  
**Example:** "She writes daily. She has published two books. Her work is influential." becomes "She writes daily and has published two influential books."

### 18. Logical Flow

Ensure ideas are logically connected and flow smoothly.  
**Example:** "He studied hard. He passed the exam." instead of "He passed the exam. He studied hard."

### 19. Avoid Split Infinitives

Keep infinitive verbs together.  
**Example:** "To quickly run" becomes "To run quickly."

### 20. Avoid Dangling Modifiers

Ensure modifiers clearly refer to the correct word.  
**Example:** "Walking down the street, the trees were beautiful" becomes "Walking down the street, she admired the beautiful trees."

### 21. Correct Use of Articles

Use "a," "an," and "the" correctly.  
**Example:** "She is a unique person" instead of "She is an unique person."

### 22. Avoid Overuse of Adverbs

Use adverbs sparingly.  
**Example:** "She very quickly ran" becomes "She sprinted."

### 23. Balance Formality and Accessibility

Use a tone that is formal yet approachable.  
**Example:** "We recommend following the instructions" instead of "It is highly recommended to follow the instructions."

### 24. Use Transitional Phrases

Use transitional phrases to connect ideas.  
**Example:** "Additionally," "However," "Therefore."

### 25. Ensure Proper Capitalization

Capitalize proper nouns and the first word of each sentence.  
**Example:** "The President of the United States" instead of "the president of the united states."

### 26. Avoid Overly Complex Sentences

Simplify complex sentences for better readability.  
**Example:** "Due to the fact that he was late, he missed the bus" becomes "Because he was late, he missed the bus."

### 27. Correct Use of Conjunctions

Use conjunctions correctly to join clauses.  
**Example:** "She likes tea and coffee" instead of "She likes tea, and coffee."

### 28. Use of Proper Tense

Maintain the correct tense for the context.  
**Example:** "He had finished his work" (past perfect) when referring to an action completed before another past action.

### 29. Avoid Overuse of Exclamations

Use exclamation marks sparingly for emphasis.  
**Example:** "That's amazing!" should be used judiciously.

### 30. Ensure Subject Clarity

Make sure the subject of the sentence is clear.  
**Example:** "After he threw the ball, the dog caught it" instead of "After throwing the ball, the dog caught it."

### 31. Use Quotations Correctly

Place punctuation marks inside quotation marks.  
**Example:** "It's time to go," she said.

### 32. Minimize first-person pronouns and use confident language

Focus on the broader implications of statements rather than personal opinions.
Replace "I believe" with more assertive phrasing or evidence-based statements.
**Example:** "I believe that we should act now" becomes "Immediate action is necessary."

### 33. Avoid vague generalizations

Use specific evidence to support claims, rather than relying on general terms like "people" or "the world."

Replace vague or weak verbs with more precise alternatives:

"chasing" → "pursuing"
Example: "I'm chasing my dreams" → "I'm pursuing my goals"

Use more formal conjunctions in place of colloquial ones:

"so" → "therefore"
Example: "It's raining, so I'll stay inside" → "It's raining; therefore, I'll remain indoors"

Replace negative constructions with positive alternatives:

"do not have" → "lack"
Example: "I do not have the necessary skills" → "I lack the required expertise"

Eliminate hedging phrases to strengthen statements:

Remove "like to," "seems to," "appears"
Example: "It seems to be effective" → "It is effective"

Replace tentative language with more decisive phrasing:

"I must" → "I will"
Example: "I must complete this task" → "I will complete this task"

Avoid absolute negatives; rephrase positively:

Rephrase "there is no," "no one"
Example: "There is no solution" → "A solution remains elusive"

Use simple past tense instead of "used to":
Example: "I used to play tennis" → "I played tennis"
Eliminate redundant phrases:

Remove "the fact," "for me"
Example: "The fact is that it's difficult" → "It's difficult"

Replace general pronouns with specific subjects:

Avoid "us," "you," "your," "we"
Example: "You should consider this" → "Readers should consider this"

Avoid broad generalizations:

Replace "most," "many," "most people" with specific quantities or demographics
Example: "Most people enjoy music" → "A 2022 survey found that 80% of respondents enjoy music"

Use concrete terms instead of abstract concepts:

"the world" → "reality"
"life" → "reality" or specific aspects of existence
Example: "That's how the world works" → "That's how this specific situation typically unfolds"

Replace "writing" with more specific terms related to the content or style
Example: "Improve your writing" → "Enhance your prose style" or "Refine your argumentative essays"
Avoid overuse of adverbs indicating frequency:

Replace "continuously" / "constantly" with specific time frames or frequencies
Example: "She's constantly working" → "She works 60 hours per week"

Use more precise adjectives:

"certain" → "particular" or "specific"
Example: "Certain people disagree" → "Specific demographic groups disagree"

Avoid absolutes unless they are factually accurate:

Rephrase "the only"
Example: "It's the only way" → "It's one effective approach"

Replace "going to" with "will" or present tense for immediacy:
Example: "I'm going to start the project" → "I will initiate the project" or "I start the project tomorrow"
