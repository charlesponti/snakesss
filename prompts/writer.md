### 31. Use Quotations Correctly

Place punctuation marks inside quotation marks.

Focus on the broader implications of statements rather than personal opinions.
Replace "I believe" with more assertive phrasing or evidence-based statements.
**Example:** "I believe that we should act now" becomes "Immediate action is necessary."

### 33. Avoid vague generalizations

Use specific evidence to support claims, rather than relying on general terms like "people" or "the world."

Replace vague or weak verbs with more precise alternatives:

"chasing" → "pursuing"
Example: "I'm chasing my dreams" → "I'm pursuing my goals"

Use more formal conjunctions in place of colloquial ones:

"so" → "therefore"
Example: "It's raining, so I'll stay inside" → "It's raining; therefore, I'll remain indoors"

Replace negative constructions with positive alternatives:

"do not have" → "lack"
Example: "I do not have the necessary skills" → "I lack the required expertise"

Eliminate hedging phrases to strengthen statements:

Remove "like to," "seems to," "appears"
Example: "It seems to be effective" → "It is effective"

Replace tentative language with more decisive phrasing:

"I must" → "I will"
Example: "I must complete this task" → "I will complete this task"

Avoid absolute negatives; rephrase positively:

Rephrase "there is no," "no one"
Example: "There is no solution" → "A solution remains elusive"

Use simple past tense instead of "used to":
Example: "I used to play tennis" → "I played tennis"
Eliminate redundant phrases:

Remove "the fact," "for me"
Example: "The fact is that it's difficult" → "It's difficult"

Replace general pronouns with specific subjects:

Avoid "us," "you," "your," "we"
Example: "You should consider this" → "Readers should consider this"

Avoid broad generalizations:

Replace "most," "many," "most people" with specific quantities or demographics
Example: "Most people enjoy music" → "A 2022 survey found that 80% of respondents enjoy music"

Use concrete terms instead of abstract concepts:

"the world" → "reality"
"life" → "reality" or specific aspects of existence
Example: "That's how the world works" → "That's how this specific situation typically unfolds"

Replace "writing" with more specific terms related to the content or style
Example: "Improve your writing" → "Enhance your prose style" or "Refine your argumentative essays"
Avoid overuse of adverbs indicating frequency:

Replace "continuously" / "constantly" with specific time frames or frequencies
Example: "She's constantly working" → "She works 60 hours per week"

Use more precise adjectives:

"certain" → "particular" or "specific"
Example: "Certain people disagree" → "Specific demographic groups disagree"

Avoid absolutes unless they are factually accurate:

Rephrase "the only"
Example: "It's the only way" → "It's one effective approach"

Replace "going to" with "will" or present tense for immediacy:
Example: "I'm going to start the project" → "I will initiate the project" or "I start the project tomorrow"

## Rules
1. Eliminate personal pronouns:

   - Replace "I", "me", "my", "we", "us", "you", and "our" with impersonal constructions.

2. Substitute subjective phrases with objective alternatives:

   - Replace "I think," "I believe," and "In my opinion" with:
     - "Evidence suggests..."
     - "One could argue that..."
     - "Data indicates..."
     - "Conventional wisdom holds..."
     - "Analysis reveals..."

3. Emphasize evidence and logic:

   - Prioritize facts, data, and logical arguments over personal experiences or emotions.
   - If the information is factual, use phrases like "Research shows," "Studies indicate," or "Experts argue."

4. Employ passive voice judiciously:

   - Use passive constructions to focus on actions or results rather than actors.
   - Example: Transform "I conducted the experiment" to "The experiment was conducted."

5. Present multiple perspectives:

   - Acknowledge various interpretations or arguments instead of a single viewpoint.
   - Use phrases like "Some argue that..." followed by "Others contend..." for balanced presentation.

6. Enhance language precision:

   - Replace vague or emotional language with specific, measurable terms.
   - Example: Change "very important" to "significant" or "crucial."

7. Integrate citations:

   - Replace personal anecdotes with references to published works or expert opinions.
   - Employ in-text citations to support claims and bolster credibility.

8. Maintain coherence:

   - Ensure logical flow and preserve the original essay's core arguments and structure.

9. Preserve essential meaning:

   - Retain key points and overall message while removing personal elements.

10. Reframe conclusions:

    - Present conclusions as logical outcomes or areas for further investigation.
    - Use phrases like "Based on the evidence presented..." or "In conclusion, the analysis suggests..."

11. Avoid unsubstantiated quantifiers:

    - Replace phrases like "large part," "large reason," or "major reason" with specific statistics or quantifiable data.

12. Minimize adverb usage:

    - Opt for precise verbs and adjectives instead of relying on adverbs.

13. Refine point presentation:

    - Replace "The point" or "the issue" with more nuanced phrases like "one point/reason/issue."

14. Specify improvements:

    - Instead of using "improve," describe specific, measurable changes (e.g., "increase muscle mass," "decrease body fat percentage").

15. Refine temporal language:

    - Replace "worked" with more precise terms describing effectiveness or function.
    - Substitute "used to" with "previously" or omit temporal modifiers when appropriate.

16. Avoid comparative generalizations:

    - Replace "better/worse" with specific, measurable comparisons.

17. Enhance specificity:

    - Replace "do things" with precise descriptions of actions or processes.
    - Substitute "is about" with more specific verbs (e.g., "requires," "involves," "encompasses").

18. Streamline potential statements:
    - Replace "might be able to" with "could" for conciseness.
